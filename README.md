# autocomplete-java
auto-completion tools for java

#TODO
I will implement more algorithms for auto-completion:

1. ternary search tree----done
1. redis based
1. ...

#Usage
You can use KeywordsAutoComplete.java directly, or build your own service by using TernarySearchTree.java.

#NOTE
I hope more and more commiters will implement more efficient algorithms.
